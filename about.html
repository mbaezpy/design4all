      <h1>About</h1>
      <p class="lead">
        The present webiste aggregates the results of a systematic literature review of research articles proposing touchscreen design guidelines for older adults. The review analysed <strong>52 research articles</strong> resulting in <strong>434 design guidelines</strong> for touchscreen applications. These guidelines were analyzed using a taxonomy that considered the older adults ability changes and the design aspects that are target of the recommendations. 
      </p> 
      
      <h2>Taxonomy</h2>
      
      We characterise the design guidelines based on a taxonomy that consider sthe characteristics of the population targeted by the design guidelines, and the aspect of the interaction design that merit the recommendations. The taxonomy is illustrated and described below:
      
      <div><img class="img-responsive" src="img/taxonomy.png"></div>
      
      <h3>User Capability model</h3>
      
      To characterize older adults, we consider the aspects that define an individual's ability to interact with a system in a <emph>user's capability model</emph>. In doing so, we aim at representing the diversity of the older adult population, and have a better understanding of the guidelines that should be enforced according to a specific target, a population with its own strengths and limitations.
      
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Perceptual abilities</strong>, including vision and hearing as primary output modalities in manipulating touchscreen devices;</li>
        <li> <strong>Cognitive abilities</strong>, such as working memory, divided attention, and information processing speed, declines of which can significantly affect user's capacity to interact with technology;</li>
        <li> <strong>Psychomotor abilities</strong>, such as slowness and imprecision in motor control and declines in hand-eye coordination, which may make touchscreen input problematic for older adults;</li>
        <li> <strong>Motor abilities</strong>, caused by a decrease in muscle strength and dexterity and resulting into mechanical difficulties in navigating touch based applications and devices themselves.</li>
      </ul>     
      
      <h3>Design categories</h3>
      <p>The design taxonomy we chose as the most suitable reflects the view that the user interface is composed of seven fundamental components: Actions, Behaviors, Contexts, Displays, Effects, Forms, and Goals, which cover both design and interaction dimensions users face while using touchscreen technologies.</p>
      
      <ul>
        <li> <strong>Behaviors</strong>, which refers to the user's interaction styles with the system, its navigation, and information input. For instance, this category includes guidelines on gestures used when using touchscreen devices or possibilities of multimodal data input;</li>
        <li> <strong>Context</strong>, which refers to the settings in which the user behavior can occur and that have effect on the performance of users. Complexity of the system content and tasks related to the  navigation are typical subcategories of "Context"; </li>
        <li><strong>Displays</strong>, denoting the visualization of information for its own sake. Typical guidelines that belong to this category span topics such as multimedia used in the systems or composition of the content, and others related to the displaying information to users;</li>
        <li><strong>Effects</strong>, denoting feedback about the system actions as a response to the user interactions. For example, this category includes guidelines about error messages displayed to older adults;</li>
        <li><strong>Forms</strong>, that refers to models or metaphors in which actions, effects and displays are embedded, for example, in relying on familiar notions to older adults when developing touchscreen applications.</li>

      </ul>

   
      
      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>We pursue the following research questions</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>RQ1. What are the characteristics of the older adult population and interaction design addressed by current research-derived guidelines for touchscreen?</strong>
  With this research question we aim at: i) analyzing the different definitions used to describe the heterogeneous older adult population, ability declines and related design support, and also ii) gaining an overview of the specific populations and design aspects addressed by current state of the art.</li>

  
    <li><strong>RQ2. What is the quality of the methods and strategies used to generate and validate the design guidelines?</strong> 
  We aim at assessing the process followed by the researchers in deriving the design guidelines (reliability), and the methods used to validate them (validity). By considering the strength of the evidence, we also highlight areas were more experimental research is needed.</li>
  
    <li><strong>RQ3. Which issues emerge and what effort is required in identifying and cataloging research-derived guidelines in order to make them available to the average practitioner?</strong> </li>
    
      </ul>

The distinct abilities of older adults to interact with touchscreen devices has motivated a wide range of contributions in the form of design guidelines, which aim at informing the design for the aging population. However, despite the growing effort by the research community, many challenges still remain in translating these research findings into actionable design guidelines, with reports hinting scant adoption or implementation issues, which ultimately hurt the development of more accessible interactive systems.

In this systematic literature review we look at the research-derived design guidelines that set the foundation for design guideline compilations and standards, analyzing the aforementioned issues from the perspective of experts trying to discover, classify, and evaluate the work on the area of  touchscreen design guidelines for older adults. The review analyses 52 research articles resulting in 434 research-derived design guidelines for touchscreen applications. These guidelines are analyzed using a taxonomy that considered the older adults ability evolution and the design aspects that are target of the recommendations.  

The results point to the use of different definition of older adults, which go as early as 55+, with design of displays and interaction styles to accommodate to vision and dexterity declines as the most prominent areas of research. However, proposed guidelines and recommendations were validated in only 15\% of articles analyzed. 

The analysis also revealed that identifying guidelines and characterizing their focus in terms of ability declines and design aspects addressed is a demanding activity and prone to error, given the quality of reporting and details offered in research articles
